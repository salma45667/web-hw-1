    The objective of Monopoly Deal is to be the first player to complete 3 full property sets on the table in front of you. Each property card tells you how many cards you need of that color to complete the set.
    For example the brown property set only needs 2 brown property cards to be completed and the black Railroad set only needs 4 Railroad property cards to be a completed set.The objective of Monopoly Deal is be the first player to complete 3 full property sets on the table in front of you. Each property card tells you how many cards you need of that color to complete the set. The brown set only needs 2 brown property cards to be completed and the black railroad set needs 4 railroad property cards to be a completed set.

     1.Each player is dealt 5 monopoly cards at the start of the game and then picks up 2 cards from the remaining draw pile at the beginning of each turn.
     2.Each player can play up to 3 cards per turn. A play is considered any time a card is played on the table (such as money into your bank, property cards on the table, action cards played into the middle, etc). You do not need to play all 3 cards per turn if you do not want to.
     3.At the end of each playerâ€™s turn, they cannot have more than 7 cards in their hand. If they do, they need to discard the excess Monopoly cards into the discard pile in the middle.
     4.Play clockwise around the table until someone completes 3 full property sets and they are the winner of that Monopoly Deal game!
